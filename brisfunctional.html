      <p>Things you might want to know:
      <ul>
        <li>An interest in functional programming is the only thing we'll ask</li>
        <li>You don't need to be an expert, or even have any experience at all.</li>
        <li>We're language-agnostic, typically we've used Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, etc but if you know something else...</li>
        <li>...We're always looking for new ideas, topics &amp; speakers.</li>
        <li>We're doing a mixture of practical stuff (looking at Project Euler, L-Systems for example) and some show-n-tell sessions as well.</li>
        <li>We might have 3 or 4 speakers in an evening, but we'll always try to include some coding</li>
        <li>Bring laptops if you like, there is wifi.  There is also pizza.</li>        <li>We meet roughly monthly, on a Tuesday.</li>

      </ul>
